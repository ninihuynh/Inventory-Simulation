# Nail Salon Inventory Simulation

This Python project simulates how a nail salon tracks and manages its daily inventory of essential products like nail polish and acrylic powder. It helps predict when items run out and when they need to be restocked.

> Designed to reflect real-world salon supply use, restocking decisions, and daily tracking.

---

## What It Does

- Simulates **30 days** of product usage in a nail salon  
- Tracks how much stock is used, when items are restocked, and when supplies run out  
- Saves **daily inventory logs** as CSV files  
- Creates a **visual chart** showing stock levels over time using Seaborn

## Technologies Used

| Tool       | Purpose                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python     | Core logic and simulation              |
| `pandas`   | Storing daily inventory logs in tables |
| `seaborn`  | Visualizing stock changes as a chart   |
| `matplotlib` | Backend for Seabornâ€™s plotting      |

## Example Products Simulated

- **Nail Polish**: High daily use, bulk restocked  
- **Acrylic Powder**: Moderate use, occasional restock  

You can easily customize these products in the code to simulate different salon supplies.
